# Wav2Vec2

This module fine-tunes Facebook's `Wav2Vec2` model for automatic speech recognition (ASR) using movie subtitles. The model learns to map raw audio waveforms to transcribed text using self-supervised representations and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss.

## Motivation

Wav2Vec2 provides strong performance in low-resource ASR tasks by leveraging unsupervised pretraining on raw audio. Our motivation is to adapt it to real-world, noisy movie dialogue, which includes diverse acoustic conditions such as music, overlapping speech, and varying audio quality.

## Architecture

![Wav2Vec2 Framework](../assets/wav2vec2_framework.png)
> llustration of Wav2Vec2 framework which jointly learns contextualized speech representations
and an inventory of discretized speech units.

### Feature Encoder

The feature encoder consists of a series of temporal convolutional layers, each followed by:

- **Layer Normalization**
- **GELU Activation**

### Contextualized representations with Transformers

The encoder outputs are passed through a **contextual network** built on the Transformer architecture. Instead of fixed positional encodings, Wav2Vec2 uses a convolutional layer for **relative positional information**, followed by:

- **GELU Activation**
- **Layer Normalization**

### Quantization Module

For self-supervised pretraining, the model discretizes encoder outputs `z` into a finite vocabulary of speech units using **product quantization**. These are compared with predictions from the Transformer to compute contrastive loss.

## Preprocessing

We used the built-in Wav2Vec2 processor from Hugging Face for audio and text preprocessing.

### Audio Preprocessing Steps

The following were done before feeding into Wav2Vec2 processor.

- **Downmixing**: Stereo audio is converted to mono by averaging channels.
- **Normalization**: Waveforms are scaled to the range `[-1, 1]` to stabilize training.
- **Resampling**: All audio is resampled to **16 kHz**, per the [Nyquist-Shannon Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem), to preserve speech information while reducing data size.

### Subtitle Preprocessing

- Spaces `" "` are replaced with `"|"` to mark word boundaries.
- Newlines (`"\n"`) are removed.
- All text is converted to **uppercase**.

## Training Setup

Training was conducted using Hugging Face's `Trainer` API.

### Model: 

```python
model = Wav2Vec2ForCTC.from_pretrained(
    "facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h",
    vocab_size=len(processor.tokenizer), # 32 in this case
    ctc_loss_reduction="mean",
    pad_token_id=processor.tokenizer.pad_token_id,
    ctc_zero_infinity=True, # zeroes infinite losses
)
```

### Data Collator

We implemented a custom collator to:

- Pad audio inputs
- Pad text token IDs and replace padding tokens with `-100` (to ignore in loss)


### Training Args

```python
output_dir="./wav2vec2-finetuned-moviesubs",
group_by_length=True,
dataloader_num_workers=4,
per_device_train_batch_size=2,
eval_strategy="epoch",
save_strategy="epoch",
load_best_model_at_end=True,
num_train_epochs=80,
fp16=False,
learning_rate=1e-7,
logging_strategy="steps",
logging_dir="./logs",
logging_steps=10,
report_to="none",
save_total_limit=1,
remove_unused_columns=False,
max_grad_norm=0.05,
```

- **Batch size = 2** due to GPU memory constraints.
- **Learning rate = 1e-7** to mitigate instability during fine-tuning.
- **Gradient clipping** (max_grad_norm = 0.05) to prevent exploding gradients.
- **fp16 disabled** due to numerical instability.
- **Early stopping** was included (but not used in the 80-epoch run).

### Trainer

```python
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset["train"],
    eval_dataset=dataset["test"],
    tokenizer=processor,
    data_collator=data_collator,
    compute_metrics=wrapped_compute_metrics,
    callbacks=[EarlyStoppingCallback(early_stopping_patience=10)],
)
```

The model improved from:

- Validation Loss: 1.9520 ‚Üí 1.7371
- WER (Word Error Rate): 0.6464 ‚Üí 0.6132

## Loss Curves

![Training vs Validation Loss](../../plots/wav2vec2_train_vs_val_loss_dark.png)

Both training and validation loss decrease together, indicating successful learning. Training loss stabilizes around **2.5**, and validation around **1.7**.

## Predictions

### Test Data

The test set consists of **five hand-picked audio segments** from *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019)*, directed by Quentin Tarantino. These samples were selected to represent a variety of real-world challenges for speech recognition systems, including:

- **Multiple speakers** with distinct voices and accents
- **Background noise** such as music, ambient sounds, and crowd noise
- **Variability in audio quality**, volume, and clarity

This diverse selection provides a meaningful benchmark for evaluating the model‚Äôs robustness under noisy, multi-speaker, and acoustically complex conditions.
